This is a ReadMe file for TheAutoMeter app created by Rishabh Minocha in collabration with Hritik Sapra for the RiseHackathon.
The AutoMeter is an app for people who commute by auto rickshaws daily. Since more than half the autometers are tampered and they give false readings, this app gives the proper readings. The app is not only for Delhi-NCR but for almost every major city in India. The app has many options such as

1) Offline Calculator- This feature can be used without internet where the user inputs the distance he has to travel(if he/she knows the approximate) and the exact fare for that distance is calculated. 

2) Offline Tracker- This feature can again be used without internet. In this feature the user can track his/her whole ride in the auto and the app will update the fare every 50 meters traveled. The user also has an option to save his/her ride for further references. 

3) Online Estimator- In this feature, the user can get an estimate of the distance from anywhere. For example, the user is at place A, he is going to place B and he/she wants to calculate how much fare will it take from B to place C since then he/she will carry that much amount of money. With this feature the user will input the pick up and drop off point and get the estimate cost without any hassle.

4) Online Tracker- With this feature, the user can travel to the destination knowing where there will be traffic and he/she can tell the auto driver to avoid the traffic by navigating using the online tracker. 

5) Reporter- There are many auto drivers who either decline the destination of travel and since they aren't allowed to decline the request, the user can report the auto by inputting the auto rickshaw plate number. The user can also report for harassing, over charging, taking longer routes purposely etc.
